# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null values and provides a solution.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.

The problem arises from the lack of explicit null checks, which can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors. The solution focuses on robust null checks and alternative return values or error handling to manage null input parameters appropriately.
